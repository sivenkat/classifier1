# Classifier
Nearest-neighbor classifier used to predict the outcome of NFL Games. The algorithm uses historical team NFL data ranging from 2007 to present. The year 2007 was chosen since that I believe that 2007 was the year the NFL transitioned to becoming to more high-scoring league it is now. I only used data for teams that made the playoffs since this was predicting playoff matchups. Algorithm used a distance function cdist from the Scipy package to find the k most similar teams to the team in question. In this case, I used a value of 5 for k. For each team, I found the 5 closest teams in the data set and calculated how many games those teams won. To predict the winner of a matchup, whichever team's historical counterparts won the most games, won the match. In this year's playoffs, the algorithm predicted 3 out of the 4 wild card games correctly. The only one it predicted incorrectly was the Vikings-Seahawks game (it predicted Vikings) and the Vikings lost because their kicker, who is generally very reliable, missed an easy field goal.
